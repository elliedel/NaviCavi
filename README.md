## About
___
NaviCavi is a dental caries detection solution developed by B.S. in Computer Science students at Our Lady of Fatima University as part of their Undergraduate Thesis project.This innovative web-based platform utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm to automatically detect and segment dental caries in panoramic dental radiographs, accurately pinpointing areas of concern.

### Features

- **Automatic Caries Detection**: Utilizes a CNN algorithm to locate dental caries with precision.
- **Tooth Type Detection**: Identifies type of tooth where the dental caries are located.
- **Saved Detection Results:** Users can save results from the detection process for future reference.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Straightforward navigation and usability.
