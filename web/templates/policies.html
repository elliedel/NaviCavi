            <h3 class="fs-4 mt-4">Account Information</h3>
            <p>
                When you create an account with NaviCavi, we collect specific details to set up and manage your profile. These details include a username and password, which are necessary for you to securely access your account. This information is crucial for ensuring only authorized users can access certain features, such as image uploads and analysis.
            </p>

            <h3 class="fs-4 mt-4">Uploaded Images</h3>
            <p>
                As part of NaviCavi’s core functionality, you may upload panoramic X-ray images for analysis. These images are used exclusively for medical purposes and do not contain any personal identifiers. The X-rays provide the visual data necessary for our AI to detect teeth and identify potential dental caries (cavities). While we handle these images with utmost care, they are not connected to any personal or identifiable information, ensuring your privacy remains intact.

            <p>We are committed to respecting the privacy and security of your medical images. Here’s a breakdown of how we process and store these images:</p>

            <h3 class="fs-4 mt-4">Processing Only</h3>
            <p>
                Your uploaded X-ray images are solely used for the intended purpose of medical analysis. Specifically, our AI model processes these images to detect teeth structures and identify any signs of caries. We do not use these images for any other purposes without your explicit consent, and they are never shared with third parties for commercial use.
            </p>

            <h3 class="fs-4 mt-4">Anonymization</h3>
            <p>
                To ensure your privacy, all images are anonymized before being used in any form of analysis beyond the immediate medical function. This means any potential information that could be used to identify you is removed. Anonymized images are occasionally used to help improve our AI model’s performance, but they are untraceable to any individual user.
            </p>

            <h3 class="fs-4 mt-4">Retention Period</h3>
            <p>
                We retain anonymized versions of the images for a period of up to three years. This extended period allows us to use a wide variety of data to train and refine our AI model, improving its ability to detect dental issues accurately. Rest assured, these images will remain anonymized throughout this period and will be securely deleted once they are no longer needed.
            </p>
